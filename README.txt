# ProblemSet1
Do **either** Problem 3 **or** Problem 4 from section 2.2. Try to follow the [data guide](http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) by Gentzkow & Shapiro by automating the data processing steps, keeping files and code organized, and, of course, using Git/GitHub.

Feel free to use or modify the file structure in this repository, which in turn follows G&S's suggestions.

### Problem 3
_Either_ replicate Tables 1 and 2 from DGR (2011) using the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances, _or_ update their tables 1 and 2 using the more recent wave of the survey from 2013. Follow the methodology as described in their text. Plot the Lorenz curves for earnings, income and wealth.

### Problem 4
Replicate a part of Table 27 from DGR using the PSID between 2001 and 2007 by constructing the transition matrix for _either_ earnings _or_ income _or_ wealth. For the outcome variable you picked, plot the Lorenz curves for 2001 and 2007 in one graph, and compute the Gini for those years.


### I chose to do problem 3 using the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances. Since the data extracted from the SCF website is quite clean, all of my work is done in the Analysis folder only. The raw data set is stored in the input folder. My Stata code can be found in the code folder and Excel
workbooks containing the replicated Table 1 and Table 2 as well as the Lorenz curves can be found in the output folder.
